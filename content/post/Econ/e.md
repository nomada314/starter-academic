1. (20) A battery manufacturer has just begun distribution of its SuperVolt, a 6-volt lantern battery for outdoor enthusiasts. Prototype tests of the new battery found the average lifetime in continuous use to be 8 hours, with a standard deviation of 2 hours. Battery lifetimes in such applications have been approximately normally distributed. Edgar Evans, the consumer reporter for a large metropolitan newspaper, has purchased one of the batteries to take along on a camping trip. On the first day of his trip, Edgar goes fishing in his rowboat, becomes disoriented, and gets lost among the many small islands in the large lake near his camp. Fortunately, Edgar has brought along his trusty flashlight and its new SuperVolt battery. At 9 P.M., Edgar turns on his flashlight and shines it into the air, hoping that someone will see his signal and rescue him. Unfortunately, it is not until 3 A.M. that searchers begin their flight over the lake. If Edgar's light is still shining as they become airborne, they will easily spot it from the air. When Edgar finally gets back to the city, what is the probability that he will have an exciting story to tell about how his flashlight and its SuperVolt battery were two of the heroes in his rescue? 
2. KleerCo supplies an under-hood, emissions-control air pump to the automative industry. The pump is vacuum powered and works while the engine is operating, cleaning the exhaust by pumping extra oxygen into the exhaust system. If a pump fails before the vehicle in which it is installed has covered 50,000 miles, regulations require that it be replace at no cost to the vehicle owner. The company's current air pump last an average of 63,000 miles, with a standard deviation of 10,000 miles. The number of miles a pump operates before becoming ineffective has been  found to be normally distributed.
* (3) For the current pump design, what percentage of the company's pumps will have to be replaced at no charge to the consumer?
* (3) What percentage of the company's pumps will fail at exactly 50,000 miles? 
* (3) What percentage of the company's pumps will fail between 40,000 and  55,000 miles? 
* (3) For what number of miles does the probability become 80\% that a randomly selected pump will no longer be effective?
* (8) The company would like to design a more durable pump so that no more than 2\% of original-equipment pumps are returned under free warranty, and the standard deviation continues to be 10,000 miles. What will the new average service life have to be in order for the new pump design to comply with the requirement?
3. (20) Some companies "grade on a bell curve" to compare the performance of their managers and professional workers. This forces the use of some low performance ratings, so that not all workers are graded "above average." Until the threat of lawsuits forced a change, Ford Motor Company's "performance management process" assigned 16% A grades, 68% B grades, and 16% C grades to the company's 18,000 managers. Suppose that Ford's performance scores are "bell-shaped". One year, managers with scores less than 25 received C's and those with scores above 475 received A's. What are the mean and standard deviation of the scores?
4. Sodium content (in milligrams) is measured for bags of potato chips sampled from a production line. The standard deviation of the sodium content measurement is $\sigma =  2$mg.  
* (10) If the sodium content is measured 4 times and the mean $\bar X$ of the 4 measurements is recorded. What is the standard deviation of the mean?
* (10) How many times must we repeat the measurement to reduce the standard deviation of $\bar X$ to 0.5?
5. Where should the control limits for an X-bar chart be placed if the design of the process sets $\alpha= 0.0027$ with the following parameters (assume that the sample size condition for control charts has been verified)?
* (10) $\mu =10$, $\sigma = 5$, and $n = 18$ cases per batch
* (10) $\mu = -4$, $\sigma = 2$, and $n = 12$ cases per batch
6. Door Seam, a truck manufacturer, monitors the width of the door seam as vehicles come off its assembly line. The seam width is the distance between the edge of the door and the truck body, in inches. These data are 62 days of measurements of a passenger door seam, with 10 trucks measured each day. It has been claimed that the process has average width 0.275 with $\sigma = 0.1.131$.
* (10) If the seam widths at this assembly line are normally distributed, then what is the probability of finding a seam wider than 1/2 inch?
* (10) If the process is under control, what is the probability of finding the mean of a daily sample of 10 widths more than 3 standard errors away from $\mu = 0.275$?
* If the process is under control, how does looking at both the X-bar and S-charts affect the chance for reaching an incorrect decision that the process is not in control, compared to looking at just the X-bar chart?
