## Testing a Hypothesis of Equal Population Variances

> A health services corporation manages two hospitals in Knoxville, Tennessee: St. Mary’s North and St. Mary’s South. In each hospital, the mean waiting time in the Emergency Department is 42 minutes. The hospital administrator believes that the St. Mary’s North Emergency Department has more variation in waiting time than St. Mary’s South.

To compare two population variances, we first state the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis is that the variance of one normal population, $\sigma_1^2$ , equals the variance of another normal population, $\sigma_2^2$. The alternate hypothesis is that the variances differ. In this instance, the null hypothesis and the alternate hypothesis are:

$$H_0: \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2$$
$$H_1: \sigma_1^2 \neq \sigma_2^2$$
