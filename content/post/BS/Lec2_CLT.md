Sampling Error
================

Samples are used to estimate population characteristics. We can therefore expect a differ- ence between a sample statistic and its corresponding population parameter. This difference is called sampling error.

**Sampling error.** The difference between a sample statistic and its corresponding population parameter.

**Example.** 

$$e = \mu - \bar{x} $$

```{r}
# Asuma que la media poblaci√≥n  es 7 y la varianza es 1.
mu = 7
muestra = rnorm(10,mu,1)
error = mu - mean(muestra)
```

Sampling distribution of the sample mean
=======================================

**Samping distribution of the sample mean** A probability distribution of all possible sample means of a given sample size.


```{r}
alturas = c()
n = 3
m1 = sample(alturas, n)
m2 = sample(alturas, n)
```

Number of possible samples

$${N \choose 3} = \frac{}{3!} =  $$
