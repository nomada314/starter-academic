## Hipothesis testing


Hypothesis testing starts with a statement, or assumption, about a population parameter—such as the population mean. This statement is referred to as a hypothesis.

A hypothesis might be that the mean monthly commission of sales associates in retail electronics stores, such as hhgregg, is USD 2,000. We cannot contact all hhgregg sales associates to determine that the mean is USD 2,000. The cost of locating and inter- viewing every hhgregg electronics sales associate in the United States would be exorbitant. To test the validity of the hypothesis ($\mu$ = USD 2,000), we must select a sample from the population of all hhgregg electronics sales associates, calculate sample statistics, and based on certain decision rules reject or fail to reject the hypothesis. A sample mean of USD 1,000 per month is much less than USD 2,000 per month and we would most likely reject the hypothesis. However, suppose the sample mean is USD 1,995. Can we attribute the $5 difference between USD 1,995 and USD 2,000 to sampling error? Or is this difference of $5 statistically significant?

**HYPOTHESIS TESTING** A procedure based on sample evidence and probability theory to determine whether the hypothesis is a reasonable statement.

## Six-stop approach for testing a hypothesis

+ **Step 1**: State the Null Hypothesis ($H_0$) and the Alternate Hypothesis ($H_1$)
+ **Step 2**: Select a Level of Significance
+ **Step 3**: Select the Test Statistic
+ **Step 4**: Formulate the Decision Rule
+ **Step 5**: Make a Decision
+ **Step 6**: Interpret the Result



### Step 1. State the Null Hypothesis ($H_0$) and the Alternate Hypothesis ($H_1$)

The first step is to state the hypothesis being tested. It is called the null hypothesis, designated $H_0$, and read “H sub zero.” 

Often, the null hypothesis begins by stating, “There is no significant difference between...” or “The mean impact strength of the glass is not significantly different from...”. When we select a sample from a population, the sample statistic is usually numerically different from the hypothesized population parameter. As an illustration, suppose the hypothesized impact strength of a glass plate is 70 psi, and the mean impact strength of a sample of 12 glass plates is 69.5 psi. We must make a decision about the difference of 0.5 psi. Is it a true difference, that is, a significant difference, or is the difference between the sample statistic (69.5) and the hypothesized population param- eter (70.0) due to chance (sampling)? 

**NULL HYPOTHESIS** A statement about the value of a population parameter developed for the purpose of testing numerical evidence.

The alternate hypothesis describes what you will conclude if you reject the null hypothesis. It is written $H_1$ and is read “H sub one.” It is also referred to as the research hypothesis. The alternate hypothesis is **retained** if the sample data provide us with enough statistical evidence that the null hypothesis is false.

**ALTERNATE HYPOTHESIS** A statement that is accepted if the sample data provide sufficient evidence that the null hypothesis is false.


> A recent article indicated the mean age of U.S. commercial aircraft is 15 years. To conduct a statistical test regarding this statement, the first step is to determine the null and the alternate hypotheses. The null hypothesis represents the current or reported condition. It is written $H_0: \mu = 15$. The alternate hypothesis is that the statement is not true, that is, $H_1: \mu\neq 15$. It is important to remember that no matter how the problem is stated, the null hypothesis will always contain the equal sign. The equal sign (=) will never appear in the alternate hypothesis. Why? Because the null hypothesis is the statement being tested, and we need a specific value to include in our calculations. We turn to the alternate hypothesis only if the data suggest the null hypothesis is untrue.
