## Point estimation of the sample mean

A point estimate is a single statistic used to estimate a population parameter. The mean of this sample is a point estimate of the population mean.

**POINT ESTIMATE:** The statistic, computed from sample information, that estimates a population parameter.

> Litchfield Home Builders Inc. builds homes in the southeastern region of the United States. One of the major concerns of new buyers is the date when the home will be completed. Recently, Litchfield has been telling customers, “Your home will be completed 45 working days from the date we begin installing drywall.” The customer relations department at Litchfield wishes to compare this pledge with recent experience. A sample of 50 homes completed this year revealed that the point estimate of the population mean is 46.7 working days from the start of drywall to the completion of the home. Is it reasonable to conclude that the population mean is still 45 days and that the difference between the sample mean (46.7 days) and the proposed population mean (45 days) is sampling error? In other words, is the sample mean significantly different from the population mean?
