The sales director for an industrial supplies firm has collected information describing the performance and personal characteristics of 80 members of her sales force. The data in file `Performance.csv` include the percent of sales quota the salesperson achieved last year, age, number of years with the firm, and personal appearance (very neat, about average, or a little sloppy). In the data file, a very neat person is coded as `Appearance = 0`, a person of average neatness is coded as `Appearance = 2`, and a sloppy person  is coded as `Appearance = 1`.  

* With percentage of sales quota as the response, perform a linear regression using the other variables as predictors.  Write down your fitted model and test the overall fit of the regression (You only need to write the hypotheses, the test statistic and  your decision).
* Find a 95% confidence interval for $\beta_{\texttt{Age} }$ using the model in part (a).
